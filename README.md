Define a function called ageCalculator. This function should take 3 parameters:
  name – a string representing someone's name
  yearOfBirth – a number representing their year of birth
  currentYear – a number representing the current year
The ageCalculator function should return a string explaining how old the person is. For example, if we called ageCalculator("Suzie", 1983, 2015);, the return value should be as follows.

"Suzie is 32 years old."

Define a function called range
  The function takes 3 integer parameters: start, end, and step.
  The function should return an array of numbers from start to end counting by step.
For example:
codeoutputrange(0, 10, 2);[ 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ]range(10, 30, 5);[ 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 ]range(-5, 2, 3);[ -5,
For example:
codeoutputrange(0, 10, 2);[ 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ]range(10, 30, 5);[ 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 ]range(-5, 2, 3);[ -5, -2, 1 ]
The function should return an empty array [] if given incorrect parameters, such as:
  start, end, or step being undefined
  start being greater than end
step being 0, or negative

Given an array of objects representing TV Shows, we want to create new arrays:
1. One including only the titles of the shows
2. One including objects that include only the title and the rating properties
3. One including only the titles of the shows, but:
  If the rating is greater or equal to 9, we put the title in upper case.
  Else, we make the title lower case.
(hint:You can create these 3 arrays using the map method)
4. One including only the TV Shows that were watched ({ watched: true })
5. One including only the TV Shows that have a rating greater or equal to 9
6. One including only the TV Shows that were first published before 2015
(hint:You can create these 3 arrays using the filter method)
const tvShows = [
  {
    title: 'True Detective',
    publishingYear: 2014,
    rating: 9,
    watched: false,
  },
  {
    title: 'The Boys',
    publishingYear: 2019,
    rating: 8.7,
    watched: true,
  },
  {
    title: 'Game of Thrones',
    publishingYear: 2011,
    rating: 9.3,
    watched: true,
  },
  {
    title: 'Mr. Robot',
    publishingYear: 2015,
    rating: 8.5,
    watched: false,
  },
  {
    title: 'Chernobyl',
    publishingYear: 2019,
    rating: 9.4,
    watched: true,
  },
  {
    title: 'Money Heist',
    publishingYear: 2017,
    rating: 8.3,
    watched: true,
  },
  {
    title: 'Dark',
    publishingYear: 2017,
    rating: 8.8,
    watched: false,
  },
];
